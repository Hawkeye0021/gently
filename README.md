Gently - a dark, gentle plasma theme

    minor disclaimer / warning: If you are going to use this theme (thanks, that's awesome!) you need to use the Kvantum theme. I have not addressed regular breeze theming / colors. You could use McMojave or the now out of date scheme here, but you'd be missing a good chunk of the theme.

A KDE Plasma theme with the intent of feeling gentle. I want the theme to be easy on the eyes, consistent, and clear. The theme is mostly based off of McMojave. The Plasma theme uses Materia icons with edited colors, and a few icons swapped in from other themes. The icon pack is Dexie-Korla, it's just the Korla icon theme with the application icons swapped in from the Dexie icon pack. 

Current agenda includes working on the Aurorae theme, just have the buttons left to do. Then I can give everything a once / twice over, make sure everything is properly authored, licensed, and documented, then work on an official release.

Other items which need attention:
-Color scheme for use without Kvantum
-Updated showcase images
-Images which demonstrate the theming morso than my perosnal setup
-Installation guide / overview
-Global theme pack
