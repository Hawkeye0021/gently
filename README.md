Gently - a dark, gentle plasma theme

OFFICIAL RELEASE!

    Using the Kvantum theme is strongly recommended!

A KDE Plasma theme with the intent of feeling gentle. I want the theme to be easy on the eyes, consistent, and clear. The theme is mostly based off of McMojave. The Plasma theme uses Materia icons with edited colors, and a few icons swapped in from other themes. The icon pack is Dexie-Korla, it's just the Korla icon theme with the application icons swapped in from the Dexie icon pack.
