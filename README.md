Gently - a dark, gentle plasma theme

    minor disclaimer / warning: If you are going to use this theme (thanks, that's awesome!) you need to use the Kvantum theme. I have not addressed regular breeze theming / colors. You could use McMojave or the now out of date scheme here, but you'd be missing a good chunk of the theme.

A KDE Plasma theme with the intent of feeling gentle. I want the theme to be easy on the eyes, consistent, and clear. The theme is mostly based off of McMojave. The Plasma theme uses Materia icons with edited colors, and a few icons swapped in from other themes. The icon pack is Dexie-Korla, it's just the Korla icon theme with the application icons swapped in from the Dexie icon pack. 

Please feel free to make suggestions, contribute, or submit issues if there's something you think should be added, fixed, or changed.

The next item on my agenda is to separate my personal dot files from this repository, properly author / document everything, and put it together as a full global theme pack :D
